## üîç Key Concepts

### 1. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**
What I learnt in this section was describe SQL injection attack, where attackers can use SQL Injection vulnerabilities to bypass application security measures. In understanding DevSecOps, a secure DevOps pipeline allows development teams to work fast without breaking their project by introducing unwanted security vulnerabilities.

### 2. **Secure DevOps Pipeline**
there are two essential features of Secure Azure Pipelines that aren't found in standard Azure Pipelines which are: 1
- **Package Management:** Adds control through approval workflows
- **Source Scanner:** Performs deep security scans on dependencies and custom code

### 3. **Threat Modeling in DevOps**
It's an engineering technique you can use to help you identify threats, attacks, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures that could affect your application.
**Five Steps of Threat Modeling:**
1. Define security requirements  
2. Create an application diagram  
3. Identify potential threats  
4. Mitigate the threats  
5. Validate that threats are mitigated
